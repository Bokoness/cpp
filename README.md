<h1>CPP</h1>

<h2>cpp files vs .h files</h2>

.h (header) files are for declarations of things that are used many times, and are #included in other files

.cpp (implementation) files are for everything else, and are almost never #included

<style>
	h1 {
		text-align:center;
	}
	h2 {
		text-align:center;
	}
</style>
